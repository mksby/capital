# Capital

### Coding challenge

Write a function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z and returns true or false.

### Important:

- Source code of programming tasks should be in pure JavaScript (no HTML, CSS, etc.).
- Imagine you’re writing an open-source library for other developers to use.
- The quality of the solution should be “production” like.
- Tests, even as simple as using console.log, are very welcome.
- Please send the source code as a link to GitHub, or any other service of your choice.
- Takes approximately 30 minutes (let us know if our estimation is correct).
